# FavoriteVacation

##This project is about my Favorite vacation places and is created by using bootstrap to make it a responsive website.
A responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices,
from small phones to large desktops and Bootstrap gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.
Bootstrap is free front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for
typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins.

### To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, added the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:
<meta name ="viewport" content ="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">.

#### Used .container class (a responsive fixed width container)to wrap the site contents.

##### Used bootstrap grid system to divide the page into rows and columns. All the grid columns should add up to twelve for a row. On
small screen all of the column content will be stacked on top of each other.

###### Used Modal plugin. The Modal plugin is a dialog box/popup window that is displayed on top of the current page. To trigger the modal window, used a button or a link. The Modal plugin includes two attributes - a)data-toggle("modal" opens the modal window) 
b)data-target("#myModal" points to the id of the modal). Used .modal-body class to define the style for the body of the modal and added paragraph about the place and also an image.
